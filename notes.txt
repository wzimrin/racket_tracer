***** Actually Important issues *****

* CS19 language
^ Test on CS19 programs
^ Test on other people
^ Planet package with latest version
* Tests for racket 

* Urgent, important, hard
^ urgent, important, easy

- Integration with Dr. Racket (guillaume)
- Trace compression

***** CURRENT ISSUES*****
- Bugs from emails
- Printing
    - Dealing with large flat data structures
- Language levels
    - Printing
    - Error checking
    - How we do let, define etc
- Check expect
    - show all check-expects, failed in red (guillaume)
- GUI
    - clickable when can't drag (display still too small)
    - (define (foo x) x) --> visual glitch (eric)
    - source code appears on left before jumping to right (chrome) (eric)
    - click on argument and highlight arguments (guillaume)
- Integration
    - wescheme (not our issue?)
    - dr racket (tool --> .plt)
- Testing
    - (this week) bootstrap
    - (this week) multiple files
- context of lst in lambda (guillaume)
- deleting temp files that are generated (guillaume)
- not dying on contracts (vs skipping contracts)
- other check forms

***** WISHLIST *****
- world film strip GUI
    - What if there's no to-draw --> major change to GUI
    - how do you display stop-when?
    - which worlds do you display?
    - is the focus the drawn world? Or the world itself?
- Play button to animate order of calls in syntax highlights
- code-paste a test case for nodes i have identified are bad (guillaume)
- Tracing errors
- Actual formals
- Matching parentheses on display on hover(?)

***** THINK ABOUT *****
- Other arguments de-expand when you shift your focus
- Google maps style zoom for arguments
- Formals/actuals not intuitive
- Make-heap and args juxtaposition not clear
- ... not necessarily clear - additional complexity

- Mouse-over scroll to right rather than using scroll bar (6/21)
- tracing failed check-expects
- Autoscroll to most recently expanded argument
